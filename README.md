Greetings! My name is Oleg, and I am a Python Backend Developer focused on building clean and reliable APIs with Django, Django REST Framework, and FastAPI. I enjoy designing logical systems, optimizing processes, and learning new technologies.
Currently I'm growing into a full-stack role, exploring React and modern frontend development.

Outside of coding, you’ll find me at the gym, climbing wall, or cycling, as well as brewing specialty tea & coffee or playing PC games. 

I'm open to junior backend opportunities and always excited to collaborate on interesting projects.
